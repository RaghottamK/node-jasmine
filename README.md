Node-Jasmine unit test

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

Setup steps - 

1. Create a project folder for Jasmine test and inside product folder run " npm init or npm init -y (for default settings) ". 
 It will create a package.json file with all the necessary information about your project.

2. Install Jasmine
    To install jasmine, Add jasmine node module as dev-dependency by running
        - npm install jasmine --save-dev (for dev-dependence) - Recommended.
        - npm install jasmine --save (for dependency).
        - npm install -g jasmine (for global installation).

3. Shortcut to open project folder in Visual studio code through cmd line - run " code .. "

4. Run npm " jasmine init " - it will create a spec folder in the project.

5. TO run tests - 
    run " jasmine " - to run the tests written inside spec folder.

6. To start node server - node server.js (or js file where code for setting up the server is wrtten);
